Short-term loans like auto title loans, payday loans and cash advances are often associated with low-income households. Income is low and therefore promotes the need for quick cash. Contrary to initial beliefs about these types of money solutions, it is not only the low-income households which rely on them.

People of all incomes fall into financial messes nowadays. Witness the foreclosed homes in residential areas around the country and you will see these signs even in some of the more affluent neighborhoods. The need for financial help has crossed over throughout all income levels. The solutions to solving these issues will rely on past management of finances.

Once in a financial crunch, where you look for help will be determined on the state of the current situation.

*How much debt do you presently carry?

*How well have you manged the debt in the past seven years?

*Are your bank accounts in good standing?

*How impressive is your credit score?

*What kind of money help do you need?

The more you know about the mess you are in and what might be offered to you for monetary support, you will be able to begin the search for relief. If your current financial opportunities will not help (limited or no savings/ no room on credit cards) and your credit score is too low to apply for new lines of credit these short-term loans tend to be available to a large percentage of this growing population.
